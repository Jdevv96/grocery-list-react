# Grocery List - React

This repo contains a sample  list app, created as part of my learning process with React.js. As of now, the app allows a user to add items to their list, as well as search for already added items and cross items off from the list. 

## Features

- Add grocery items to the list
- Mark items as completed and remove from list
- Filter and search capabilites to find specific items
- CRUD functionality to persist list data

## Features still to come
- Responsive design, for an enjoyable experience on any device
- Login functionality to save users unique lists
- API integration to allow for detailed grocery item cost in real time 

### Tools used

- React.js 
- HTML 
- CSS
- JSON-Server (Prototype DB)

## Getting Started:
1. After cloning this repo and verifying Node.js has been installed on your device, you'll want to install the necessary dependencies by running: *npm install*.
2. To startup the server run the command: *npx json-server -w data/db.json*. You may also specify which port you'd like to use by running: *npx json-server -p {desired port} -w data/db.json* (example: *npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json*).
3. To run the react app, use: *npm start*.
4. Once the above commands have been ran, the app should be able to open on your local device using the default or specified port.
